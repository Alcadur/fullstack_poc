### What is this?
This is a simple "TODO list" application that demonstrates my skills in different areas of web development.

### How to use it?
1. Clone this repository. 
2. In main directory run `docker-compose up -d` to build and run DB and API

    1. If you don't have a docker installed, I strongly recommend you to install it :). 

    2. You can also set up DB and build API manually. All necessary data should be in `docker-compose.yml`

### What is missing?
Please take note that this is Proof of Concept, and I am aware of the luck of security. I will "fix" that after I finished the main goal.
